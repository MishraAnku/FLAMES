# FLAMES
PYTHON PROJECT 
1.	PROJECT EXPLANATION
The project, named FLAMES, is a simple tkinter-based application that allows users to play the FLAMES game. FLAMES is a popular game among young people to determine the relationship between two individuals based on their names. The acronym FLAMES stands for Friends, Love, Affection, Marriage, Enemy, and Siblings. The project takes the names of two individuals as input, applies the FLAMES algorithm to determine the relationship between them, and displays the result.
2.	CHALLENGES
Implementing the FLAMES algorithm correctly to determine the relationship based on the input names.
Handling user input validation and error handling.

3.	CHALLENGES OVERCOMED
The FLAMES algorithm was implemented by removing common letters from the names and calculating a number to determine the relationship.
Input validation was implemented to ensure that the user enters valid names before proceeding to calculate the result.

4.	AIM 
The aim of the FLAMES project is to provide users with a fun and interactive way to determine the relationship between two individuals based on their names. It aims to recreate the traditional FLAMES game experience in a digital format.
5.	PURPOSE 
The purpose of the FLAMES project is to entertain users and provide them with a lighthearted activity to enjoy with their friends or crushes. It can be used as a fun icebreaker or as a way to pass the time.
6.	ADVANTAGE
Provides a simple and fun way to determine the relationship between two individuals.
Can be easily accessed and used on any device with Python installed.
Helps users learn basic programming concepts through a practical project.

7.	DISADVANTAGE
Relies solely on the FLAMES algorithm, which may not accurately reflect the complexities of real-life relationships.
Limited interactivity and depth compared to more sophisticated relationship analysis tools.

8.	WHY THIS PROJECT IS USEFULL?
It provides entertainment and amusement for users.
It can serve as a conversation starter or bonding activity.
It introduces users to basic programming concepts .

9.	APPLICATIONS 
Icebreaker: FLAMES can be used as an icebreaker activity in social gatherings, parties, or team-building events. It provides a lighthearted way for people to interact and get to know each other better.
Entertainment: The game is often played for entertainment purposes among friends or during leisure time. It can be a fun way to pass the time and spark conversations.
Relationship Exploration: While not scientifically accurate, some individuals may use the FLAMES game to explore potential romantic connections or assess the compatibility between themselves and another person. It's important to note that the results are typically viewed in a playful and non-serious manner.

10.	TOOLS USED
Python programming language
11.	CONCLUSION
Overall, the Flames game implementation has provided valuable insights into string manipulation, algorithm design, and user interaction in Python. By considering potential enhancements and building upon the foundation laid in this project.
